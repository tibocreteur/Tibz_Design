    "presentationomodaka":"Omodaka is a project I created to bring serenity and tranquility to those seeking refuge from the chaos of everyday life. My approach is rooted in the belief that calmness is essential for mental and emotional well-being.<br><br>The word Omodaka comes from Japanese (オモダカ), where it refers to an aquatic plant known as the 'arrowhead' (Sagittaria trifolia in Latin). This plant, often found in peaceful environments like ponds and rivers, symbolizes tranquility and the purity of nature. The Omodaka project draws inspiration from landscapes around the world, capturing the essence of various places through unique fragrances.\n\nEach scent reflects the atmosphere and emotions evoked by these regions, offering an immersive sensory experience. At Omodaka, each fragrance is crafted to take you on a calming and sensory journey, allowing you to reconnect with yourself and nature through the scent of these inspiring landscapes.",
