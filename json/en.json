I chose a cubic shape for the box, symbolizing simplicity and balance‚Äîvalues deeply rooted in Japanese culture. This minimalist design is inspired by traditional Japanese elements, which highlight the beauty of simplicity and the harmony of shapes.\n\nA band around the box adds a touch of sophistication while creating a sense of protection, reflecting the idea of refuge and calm that we wish to offer our users. The map of the location on the box pays tribute to the inspiring landscapes that guided the creation of each fragrance, allowing users to embark on a sensory journey.

        "colorsomodaka": "The concept behind each Omodaka fragrance comes from observing the natural colors of the chosen locations. Each region inspires not only a scent but also specific shades that capture its essence. For example, Provence evokes lavender and golden tones, while the Lofoten Islands, with their snowy landscapes, inspire icy blues and pure whites. This approach allows each fragrance to reflect the atmosphere of the place, offering a sensory journey that is both visual and aromatic.",
        "logoomodaka": "The logo I created for Omodaka uses typography in a subtle way to evoke the world of fragrances. The letter \"O\" is distorted to resemble a circle, symbolizing a perfume bottle or container. In one of the variations, this \"O\" is positioned beneath a rectangle, representing a rim, from which sticks emerge, similar to those used to diffuse scents. This detail directly references the sensory experience and the art of perfuming spaces. The typography remains minimalist and elegant, creating a balance between modernity and refinement, while symbolizing the calming atmosphere and harmony the products bring to the home.",

My approach is rooted in the belief that calmness is essential for mental and emotional well-being.<br><br>The word Omodaka comes from Japanese („Ç™„É¢„ÉÄ„Ç´), where it refers to an aquatic plant known as the 'arrowhead' (Sagittaria trifolia in Latin). This plant, often found in peaceful environments like ponds and rivers, symbolizes tranquility and the purity of nature. The Omodaka project draws inspiration from landscapes around the world, capturing the essence of various places through unique fragrances.\n\nEach scent reflects the atmosphere and emotions evoked by these regions, offering an immersive sensory experience. At Omodaka, each fragrance is crafted to take you on a calming and sensory journey, allowing you to reconnect with yourself and nature through the scent of these inspiring landscapes.",

        "presentatioomodaka":"After several observations at the Plan de la Garde Natural Park, Margaux and I noticed that the locations of interesting observation spots were not sufficiently highlighted for visitors. That‚Äôs why we took the initiative to create a mobile application to address this issue. The basic principle of the application relies on a map system where users can see points of interest: plants, water sources, wildlife and flora.\n\nUsers can visit the points of interest highlighted by the park, but they can also place their own locations. Subsequently, a public image bank is created for each point, allowing users to track the evolution of nature.",
        "colorsmouvaplan":"The different shades of green directly evoke nature, symbolizing freshness and vitality. They create a calming atmosphere that encourages exploration and connection with the environment. We have added a beige hue to bring warmth and welcome, balancing the dominant green. This creates a visually pleasing and inviting space for the user. Finally, orange has been integrated to introduce a dynamic touch. This vibrant color captures attention and adds a sporty energy, encouraging exploration and outdoor activities. Together, these colors establish a harmonious and engaging visual experience, perfectly suited to our theme.",
        "logomouvaplan":"The logo combines a location icon and a heron to symbolize the balance between technology and nature.

        "figmamouvaplan":"For the creation of Mouvaplan, I chose Figma because it was the simplest and quickest way to bring my designs to life. The tool allowed me to easily prototype my ideas and gain a clear vision of the interface. Additionally, its flexibility and ease of use enabled me to focus on creativity rather than technical aspects.",
        "meteomouvaplan":"I integrated a real-time weather system into the app to enhance the visitor experience.

With its sturdy and minimalist design, it appears both familiar and from an alternate future, evoking sci-fi films like Blade Runner, where every object has a mysterious story. Its screen displays \"Now Loading\" in glowing green letters, reinforcing the idea that it is downloading something special. But at the end of the loading, it is not a prophecy or a cryptic message that appears: it‚Äôs a game. Like a lost artifact, Li√∫zh√¨ makes waiting a moment of anticipation, transforming the simple act of loading a game into a unique experience, where the nostalgia of the past meets the intrigue of an unknown future.",
