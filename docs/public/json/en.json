The <strong>Omodaka</strong> project <strong>draws inspiration from landscapes around the world</strong>, capturing the essence of different places through unique fragrances.<br><br>Each scent reflects the atmosphere and emotions evoked by these regions, offering <strong>an immersive sensory experience</strong>.

Subsequently, a public image bank is created for each point, allowing users to track the evolution of nature.",
        "colorsmouvaplan": "The different shades of <strong>green</strong> directly evoke nature, symbolizing freshness and vitality. They create a calming atmosphere that encourages exploration and connection with the environment.
